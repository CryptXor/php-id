# php-id
A tool to help identify the protection of a PHP file
Please do take note that this is a very simple, yet messy way of going about the detection process. I might change everything if there is actual interest in the project, to be much more efficient and bolster many additional features.

Draws inspiration from Manhunter's ID tool and PEiD!
